Data Types 

Int , Varchar, text, boolean char ,string,date, time, datetime, current_timestamp


Numeric Data Types  -> number ( decimal points, integers)

Character Data Types -> varchar  ( store any kind of character)

Date/Time Data Types -> date/time, datetime, current_timestamp

Binary Data Types -> True, False 

NULL Values  -> Null value 

Data Types
Data types in SQL define the kind of values that can be stored in a column of a table. 
They help maintain data integrity and ensure that the correct type of data is used for specific operations. 
SQL provides a wide range of data types that can be categorized into three main groups: 
Character Types, Numeric Types, and Date/Time Types. 
These categories cover various kinds of data, from text and numbers to dates and times.

Person(table)-> name Column varachar ( 30 )

Here are the key reasons why careful consideration is essential:

1. Data Integrity
Choosing the right data type helps ensure that the data stored in the database aligns with its intended format. 
For example, using a numeric data type for storing ages ensures that only valid numerical values are entered, reducing the risk of data corruption.

2. Storage Efficiency
Selecting the appropriate size for character strings or numeric data types is critical for optimizing storage space within your database. 
By using data types that accurately reflect the expected data size, you can minimize waste and improve overall database performance.

3. Performance
Database performance can be significantly enhanced by effectively choosing data types. 
Queries can execute faster when the data types align with the operations performed. 
For instance, calculations involving numeric data types are generally more efficient than those using string representations, 
leading to improved query execution times.

Person(table) -> email varchar(50) (not null) -> key constants  default('indian@gmail.com')

id , name, age, email  phone , address , created_at , updated_at
1     A    19    Null  133     XYZ        13-02-2025   2025-02-13
2     B    20          134     PQR        13-02-2025   2025-02-13

AUTO_INCREMENT

This constraint automatically generates a unique value for a specified column when a new record is inserted into the table. 
It is often used for primary keys to simplify ID assignment.
